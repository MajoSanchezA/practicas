### MY PRESENTATION

Hi, my name is María Sánchez, I'm 16 years old, I'm from Santa, I'm an ADSO apprentice at Sena. I love sleeping, cats especially mine, I like fast food, for example salchipapa, pizza, I hate liver with onions and melon juice, my favorite music is pop especially Harry Styles songs, although I also listen to trap. I consider myself a person who cries a lot, and that's it. Thank you
